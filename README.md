### What?
ETL, or Extract, Transform, and Load, is a process in data engineering that is important for manipulating data. It is mainly used to organize data in data warehouses (cloud servers) where companies can analyze it for business purposes. 
### Why?
The ETL process is important for businesses that deal with vast amounts of data. The process makes it easier for them to read, analyze, and in turn, use their data to benefit and grow their business further.
